Based on your request to "write file by format" and the context of the previous interactions, I assume you want the README content written to a file in Markdown format (`README.md`) as per the professional README provided for the Najran Public Health Authority Dashboard. Below, I'll provide the README content in a format suitable for saving as a `README.md` file. If you meant a different format or file type, please clarify, and I can adjust accordingly.

# Najran Public Health Authority Dashboard

## Overview
The **Najran Public Health Authority Dashboard** is an advanced, interactive web application developed using **Streamlit** and **Plotly** to provide comprehensive analytics and visualizations for public health performance at border crossings in Najran for the year 2025. The dashboard offers real-time insights into key health metrics, including traveler counts, pilgrim and hajj activities, clinic visits, emergency cases, vaccinations, and supervisory inspections. It supports data input, advanced analytics, and predictive modeling to aid decision-making.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Includes bar charts, line charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and 3D scatter plots to visualize monthly and quarterly health data.
- **Data Input Forms**: Allows users to input and update data for Q3 and Q4 of 2025, with automatic calculations for total vaccinations and overall totals.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Displays key performance indicators (KPIs), quarterly analysis, and predictive trends for travelers and clinic visits.
- **Custom Styling**: Utilizes a modern, glassmorphism-inspired design with Arabic fonts (Cairo and Amiri) and dynamic animations for an enhanced user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices with adaptive layouts and scrollable content.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Includes correlation heatmaps and predictive modeling with a 5% growth rate assumption for future projections.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the interactive web application.
- **Plotly**: Used for creating dynamic and interactive charts.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and storage.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for a modern, visually appealing interface.
- **HTML**: Embedded in Streamlit for custom UI components.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/najran-health-dashboard.git
   cd najran-health-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Requirements File**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` with the following:
   ```
   streamlit==1.25.0
   pandas==2.0.3
   numpy==1.24.3
   plotly==5.15.0
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Access the Dashboard**: Open the application in a web browser (default: `http://localhost:8501`).
2. **Navigate Sections**:
   - **Main KPIs**: View total travelers, pilgrims, clinic visits, and emergency cases.
   - **Total Analysis**: Explore monthly and quarterly totals via bar and pie charts.
   - **Vaccination Analysis**: Analyze vaccination trends with line charts, pie charts, and heatmaps.
   - **Emergency & Clinic Visits**: Visualize clinic visits and emergency cases with combined bar and line charts.
   - **Quarterly Analysis**: Dive into detailed Q1 and Q2 data, and input data for Q3 and Q4.
   - **3D Gauges**: Monitor clinic efficiency, emergency response, vaccination rates, and inspection efficiency.
   - **Advanced Analytics**: Review correlation heatmaps and predictive trends for 2026.
3. **Data Input**: Use forms in Q3 and Q4 tabs to update health metrics, which are automatically saved to the session state.
4. **Export Options**: Download charts as PNG or export data as CSV for further analysis.

```

## Data Structure
The dashboard uses a Pandas DataFrame (`health_df`) stored in the Streamlit session state with the following columns:
- `الشهر` (Month): Month names for 2025.
- `عدد العابرين` (Travelers): Number of border crossing travelers.
- `عدد المعتمرين` (Pilgrims): Number of Umrah pilgrims.
- `عدد الحجاج` (Hajj Pilgrims): Number of Hajj pilgrims.
- `زيارات العيادة` (Clinic Visits): Number of clinic visits.
- `حالات النقل الإسعافي وحالات الإشتباه` (Emergency Cases): Emergency and suspected cases.
- `الجولات الإشرافية` (Inspections): Number of supervisory inspections.
- `شلل الأطفال` (Polio): Polio vaccinations.
- `مخية شوكية` (Meningitis): Meningitis vaccinations.
- `ثلاثي فيروسي` (Triple Viral): Triple viral vaccinations.
- `مجموع التطعيمات` (Total Vaccinations): Sum of all vaccinations.
- `المجموع الكلي` (Grand Total): Sum of all metrics per month.

## Customization
- **Styling**: Modify the CSS in the `st.markdown` section to adjust colors, fonts, or animations.
- **Data**: Update the initial DataFrame in `dashboard.py` to include new metrics or time periods.
- **Visualizations**: Extend Plotly charts by adding new traces or modifying layouts in the respective sections.
- **Predictions**: Adjust the `growth_rate` variable in the predictions section for different forecasting scenarios.
